    "----------------\n",
    "Based on the work of the introductory notebook `01_Introduction.ipynb` (data transposition, and data density calculations) I have the information I need to make reasoned reductions to the dataframe, by removing independent variables that contain a substantial proportion of NaN values. To acomplish this I will use the `data_density.csv` file I created, and establish a minimum data density cut-off for variables to remain in the dataset. Independent variables that do not meet this threshhold will be removed from the transposed `raw_health.csv` file."

    "##### Observations\n",
    "It appears as though there are still a significant number of missing values in the dataset (10,423). Most of these missing values however appear to be conentrated in only a few independent variables, with the vast majority of independent variables having very few or no missing data. From these observations, I am confident that reasonable data imputation can be undertaken to fill out the dataframe for the majority of independent variables. Those independent variables that contain a high proportion of NaN values will have to be looked at in more detail to determine if data imputation is appropriate. \n",
