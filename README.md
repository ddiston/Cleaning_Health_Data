# Cleaning Health Data
This repository contains a personal project to show my data cleaning, EDA, and visualization skills. My ongoing process will be updated with individual notebooks for each step in the cleaning/EDA/visualization process. My final goal is to build an interactive dashboard using Tableau to clearly visualize the most pertinent observations from the exploratory process.
